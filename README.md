# Predicting Churn with a Multi-Layer Perceptron

Welcome to my machine learning project on predicting churn using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)!

In this project, I aim to build a model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn (i.e. stop using a product or service) based on their past behavior and other relevant features. To do this, I will use a MLP, a type of neural network that can be well-suited for prediction tasks.

I will be using Google Colab as my development platform, allowing me to easily access and manipulate data, as well as train and evaluate my model. The data for this project will be sourced from a simulated customer churn dataset that I got from a friend at college, which includes a range of features such as: where are they from, age, gender, is a active member, estimated salary and ETC...

Throughout the project, I will go through the following steps:

1. **Data exploration and preparation:** I will start by exploring the dataset to get a better understanding of its structure and the relationships between different features. This will include tasks such as scaling numeric features and droping columns that we are not going to use.

2. **Model building and training:** Next, I will build and train my MLP model using the prepared data. This will involve selecting the appropriate model architecture and training the model using a fit function.

3. **Model evaluation:** After training the model, I will evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset to see how well it generalizes to unseen data. I will use a range of metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to assess the model's effectiveness.

By the end of this project, I will have a MLP model that is capable of accurately predicting customer churn. I will also have gained valuable experience working with neural networks and Google Colab, as well as a deeper understanding of the steps involved in building and evaluating machine learning models.

So let's get started!
